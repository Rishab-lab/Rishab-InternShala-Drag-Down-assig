ï‚«	To run this code in Visual Studio Code, you can follow these steps: 
1.	Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file. 
2.	Copy and paste the provided code into the new file. 
3.	Save the file with a .html extension (e.g., drag-and-drop.html). 
4.	Open the saved HTML file in the default browser directly from Visual Studio Code. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Open with Live Server" or by installing the "Live Server" extension and clicking on the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner of the editor. 
5.	If you don't want to use Live Server, you can simply right-click on the file and select "Open with" and choose your preferred browser. 
6.	The HTML file will open in the browser, and you can interact with the drag and drop functionality. Please make sure you have Live Server installed in Visual Studio Code if you choose to use that method. If not, you can still run the code by opening the HTML file directly in a browser.
